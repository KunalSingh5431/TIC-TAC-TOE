- **AI Algorithm:** Minimax algorithm

## ▶️ Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KunalSingh5431/TIC-TAC-TOE.git
    cd TIC-TAC-TOE
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed. You can install any necessary dependencies using:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the game:**
    ```sh
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## 🖥️ How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is X and Player 2 (or the AI) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is considered a draw.

## AI Algorithm

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. This ensures a challenging game experience for the player.
